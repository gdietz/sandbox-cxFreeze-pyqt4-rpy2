sandbox-py2app-pyqt-rpy2
========================

Example of using pyqt4, cxFreeze and rpy2 together to make a mac app using R on the
backend to perform a calculation.

notes:
	I installed R, python27 and pyqt4 via macports. I installed cxFreeze and rpy2 via pip locally in a virtualenv built from the macport-installed python. The virtualenv was build using the --system-site-packages option so it can see PyQt4 in the macports python installation.
